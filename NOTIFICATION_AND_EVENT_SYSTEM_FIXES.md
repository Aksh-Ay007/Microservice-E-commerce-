# üîî Notification & Event System - Complete Fix & Enhancement

## üìã Overview
This document outlines all the fixes and enhancements made to the notification and event system across your multi-service e-commerce platform.

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Backend Issues**

#### a) Seller Notification Route Fixed
**File:** `/workspace/apps/seller-service/src/routes/seller.router.ts`

**Problem:** 
```typescript
router.use("/seller-notifications", isSellerAuthenticated, isSeller, sellerNotification);
```

**Fixed to:**
```typescript
router.get("/seller-notifications", isSellerAuthenticated, isSeller, sellerNotification);
```

**Why:** `router.use()` is for middleware, not for defining GET endpoints. Changed to `router.get()` for proper HTTP GET request handling.

---

#### b) Notification Creation on Product/Event Creation
**File:** `/workspace/apps/product-service/src/controllers/product.controller.ts`

**What was added:**

**For Product Creation (`createProduct` function):**
- When a seller creates a product, notifications are now automatically sent to all admins
- Notification type: `product`
- Priority: `normal`
- Includes redirect link to the product page

**For Event Creation (`createEvent` function):**
- When a seller creates an event, notifications are sent to:
  1. **All admins** (priority: `high`)
  2. **All followers of the shop** (priority: `normal`)
- Includes event start date in the message
- Includes redirect link to the event page

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Create notifications for admins about new product
const admins = await prisma.users.findMany({
  where: { role: "admin" },
  select: { id: true },
});

const notificationPromises = admins.map((admin) =>
  prisma.notifications.create({
    data: {
      creatorId: req.seller.id,
      receiverId: admin.id,
      title: "New Product Created",
      message: `A new product "${title}" has been created`,
      type: "product",
      priority: "normal",
      redirect_link: `/product/${slug}`,
    },
  })
);

await Promise.all(notificationPromises);
```

### 2. **Frontend Issues**

#### a) User Notifications Page Created
**File:** `/workspace/apps/user-ui/src/app/(routes)/notifications/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Complete notification management UI
- ‚úÖ Filter by: All, Unread, Read
- ‚úÖ Mark as read functionality
- ‚úÖ Delete notifications
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for unread notifications
- ‚úÖ Priority-based color coding (urgent, high, normal, low)
- ‚úÖ Type-based icons (order, product, system, general)
- ‚úÖ Time ago display (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
- ‚úÖ Redirect links to relevant pages
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates with React Query

**API Endpoint:** `/api/get-user-notifications`

---

#### b) Seller Notifications Page Created
**File:** `/workspace/apps/seller-ui/src/app/(routes)/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Same features as user notifications page
- ‚úÖ Dark theme matching seller dashboard
- ‚úÖ Optimized for seller workflow

**API Endpoint:** `/seller/api/seller-notifications`

**Note:** The sidebar already had a "Notifications" menu item that now works correctly!

---

#### c) User Profile Page Updated
**File:** `/workspace/apps/user-ui/src/app/(routes)/profile/page.tsx`

**What changed:**
- When clicking "Notifications" tab in profile, it now shows a link to the dedicated notifications page
- Added a quick action button to navigate to `/notifications`

---

## üéØ How the Event System Works

### Event vs Product Distinction
Events are stored in the same `products` table but are distinguished by:
- `starting_date` is NOT NULL
- `ending_date` is NOT NULL

### Event Creation Flow

1. **Seller creates event** via `/dashboard/create-event`
2. **Backend validates** all required fields including dates
3. **Event is saved** to products table with event dates
4. **Notifications are triggered:**
   - All admins receive notification (high priority)
   - All shop followers receive notification (normal priority)
5. **Event appears** in:
   - Admin dashboard ‚Üí Events section
   - Seller dashboard ‚Üí All Events
   - User UI ‚Üí Events/Offers pages

### Event Data Structure
```typescript
{
  title: string,
  slug: string,
  short_description: string,
  detailed_description?: string,
  starting_date: Date,     // ‚úÖ Required for events
  ending_date: Date,       // ‚úÖ Required for events
  category: string,
  subCategory: string,
  stock: number,
  sale_price: number,
  regular_price: number,
  tags: string[],
  images: Array<{fileId: string, file_url: string}>
}
```

## üîê Authentication Flow

### User Notifications
- Endpoint: `GET /api/get-user-notifications`
- Middleware: `isAuthenticated`
- Returns: User's notifications based on `receiverId === user.id`

### Seller Notifications
- Endpoint: `GET /seller/api/seller-notifications`
- Middleware: `isSellerAuthenticated, isSeller`
- Returns: Seller's notifications based on `receiverId === seller.id`

### Admin Notifications
- Endpoint: `GET /admin/api/notifications`
- Middleware: `isAuthenticated, isAdmin`
- Returns: All notifications (admin can see everything)

---

## üìä Notification Schema

```prisma
model notifications {
  id            String               @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  creatorId     String               @db.ObjectId
  receiverId    String               // User/Seller/Admin ID
  redirect_link String?
  title         String
  message       String
  status        notificationStatus   @default(Unread)  // Read | Unread
  type          notificationType     @default(general) // order | product | system | general
  priority      notificationPriority @default(normal)  // low | normal | high | urgent
  createdAt     DateTime             @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime             @updatedAt
  
  creator users @relation("NotificationCreator", fields: [creatorId], references: [id])
}
```
