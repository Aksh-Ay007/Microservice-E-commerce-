#### Key Flows:

- **User Registration**: Validates input, checks for existing user, sends OTP, tracks OTP requests, and creates user after OTP verification.
- **Seller Registration**: Similar to user, but with additional fields (phone, country).
- **Login**: Validates credentials, issues JWT access and refresh tokens, sets secure cookies.
- **Password Reset**: Handles forgot password, OTP verification, and password update.
- **Token Refresh**: Securely refreshes access tokens using refresh tokens.

### User UI (`apps/user-ui`)

- **Pages**: Login, signup (with OTP), forgot password, profile, wishlist, cart.
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/useUser.ts` for fetching and caching user data.
- **Utils**: `src/utils/axiosinstance.ts` for API calls with automatic token refresh.
- **Widgets**: `src/shared/widgets/header/` for dynamic header and sticky navigation.
- **Components**: Google login button, OTP input, etc.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive UI.
- **React Query**: For data fetching and caching.
- **React Hook Form**: For robust form validation and UX.

#### Key Flows:

- **Signup**: Multi-step with OTP, password visibility toggle, Google signup.
- **Login**: Email/password, Google login, "Remember Me", error handling.
- **Forgot Password**: Email submission, OTP verification, password reset.
- **Header**: Dynamic user info, profile link, wishlist/cart, sticky navigation.

### Seller UI (`apps/seller-ui`)

- **Pages**: Multi-step signup (with OTP), login, shop setup, bank connection, dashboard.
- **Form Validation**: Country/phone validation, OTP resend with timer.
- **Modern UX**: Styled with Tailwind CSS, React Query, React Hook Form.

### API Gateway (`apps/api-gateway`)

- **Express-based**: Central entry point for all microservices.
- **Proxying**: Forwards requests to appropriate services.
- **Assets**: Static assets and main entry.

### Shared Packages

- **error-handler**: Custom error classes and Express error middleware.
- **libs/prisma**: Prisma client and schema.
- **libs/redis**: Redis client and helpers.
- **middleware**: Shared Express middleware (e.g., authentication).

### Database Models (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

- **users**: id, name, email, password, avatar, following, reviews, timestamps.
- **sellers**: id, name, email, phone, country, password, stripeId, shop, timestamps.
- **shops**: id, name, bio, category, avatar, address, ratings, reviews, sellerId, timestamps.
- **shopReviews**: id, userId, rating, review, shopId, timestamps.
- **images**: id, file_id, url, userId, shopId.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

The workflow below describes the high-level user and system interactions in the E-commerce microservices platform. Each step is designed to ensure security, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

1. **User/Seller visits UI (Next.js)**

   - Users and sellers can register, login, or reset their password from the respective Next.js frontends.

2. **Registration**

   - User/Seller submits the registration form.
   - Auth Service validates the data, checks for existing accounts, and sends an OTP via email.
   - User/Seller enters the OTP to verify their account.
   - On successful verification, the account is created in MongoDB via Prisma.

3. **Login**

   - User/Seller submits their credentials.
   - Auth Service validates the credentials, issues JWT access and refresh tokens, and sets secure cookies.
   - The UI stores the session and fetches user data via `/api/logged-in-user`.

4. **Password Reset**

   - User/Seller requests a password reset.
   - Auth Service sends an OTP to the registered email.
   - User/Seller verifies the OTP and sets a new password.

5. **Token Refresh**

   - If the access token expires, the UI uses the refresh token to obtain a new one (handled automatically by the axios interceptor).

6. **API Gateway**

   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices (auth, user, seller, etc.).

7. **Shared Packages**

   - Error handling, Prisma, Redis, and middleware are reused across all services for consistency and maintainability.

8. **CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions run tests and build processes on every push or pull request to ensure code quality and reliability.

    ///common error


1. Your first error
Failed to clean up the workspace data directory.
Error: EBUSY: resource busy or locked


This happens when some process (like the Nx daemon, Node process, or your editor) is still holding a lock on .nx/workspace-data/...db.


solution


‚úÖ Fix:

Stop all Node processes:

npx nx reset --force
taskkill /F /IM node.exe


Then retry:

npx nx reset


If you want to support time-limited products in the future, add the date filter only when you actually have products with dates set:

const now = new Date();
const baseFilter: Prisma.productsWhereInput = {
  isDeleted: false,
  status: "Active",
  // Only add date logic when needed
  OR: [
    { starting_date: null, ending_date: null },
    { starting_date: { lte: now }, ending_date: { gte: now } },
  ],
};




<!-- nx erroor -->

<!-- isuueee -->
npx nx g @nx/express:app apps/kafka-service


 NX   The name should match the pattern "(?:^@[a-zA-Z0-9-*~][a-zA-Z0-9-*._~]*\/[a-zA-Z0-9-~][a-zA-Z0-9-._~]*|^[a-zA-Z][^:]*)$". The provided value "@./kafka-service-e2e" does not match.

Pass --verbose to see the stacktrace.

npx nx g @nx/express:app kafka-service --directory=apps/kafka-service --e2eTestRunner=none
